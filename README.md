# Week 2: OSSEC & Wireshark Engagement

This repository contains two resources for cybersecurity hands-on learning and incident detection:

## 📘 `Week_2_Prompt_Engagement.pdf`
A practical lab guide that walks students through analyzing DNS, TCP/TLS, and ICMP traffic using Wireshark. Key takeaways include:

- Detecting suspicious DNS tunneling or tracking via CNAMEs
- Spotting TCP retransmissions and signs of DoS/MITM
- Understanding ICMP scans and firewall behavior

## ⚙️ `ossec_quick_reference.txt`
A command-line cheat sheet for OSSEC/Wazuh-based alert generation. Includes:

- Start/status commands for `wazuh-control`
- Common actions that trigger OSSEC alerts (user creation, file access, etc.)
- Real-world examples for lab testing

> Ideal for Week 2 cybersecurity labs focusing on both network analysis and host-based intrusion detection.
